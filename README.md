### This repository contains the official code for the NeurIPS 2025 paper: **"Time-Embedded Algorithm Unrolling for Computational MRI"**.

It provides an implementation of the proposed time-embedded unrolling algorithm for MRI reconstruction.

### 1. Create Conda Environment and Install Requirements

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml -n {env_name}
conda activate {env_name}

cd TE-Unrolling-MRI
pip install requirement.txt
```

### 2. Run Train / Test Code
```bash
sh task.sh
```
You can configure the number of unrolling steps, acceleration rate, dataset, loss domain, model, and unrolling algorithm in `task.sh`. \
The configurations corresponding to the settings reported in the paper are automatically implemented in `configs.py`. \
For additional custom configurations, please edit `configs.py` accordingly.

### 3. Run Demo Code
We provide a checkpoint of the pre-trained ResNet model with our proposed method (PD, R=4, 10unrolls):

```bash
sh demo.sh
```
